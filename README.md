# Creating a Robust C# Program with Copilot agent At GitHub

Follow the instructions on this readme to Create a C# Console App using GitHub Copilot Only from an application shell with GitHub Copilot using issues and pull request reviews.

## Using VSCode

If you would like to see a similar solution using VS Code [Check Out This Repo](...)  

## Prerequisites

Set up a repo at GitHub and clone it locally (establishes main branch upstream tracking).  Give it a Visual Studio .gitignore, a README.md and a license of choice. 

Add the code found in the `./Starter/Starter.zip` file to the repo. This will stub in the project shell.  Ensure that the code runs as expected from your local machine before pushing to GitHub.

>**Note**: It is likely you would have been able to start from scratch entirely using issues.  For simplicity, this demo sets a project shell in place so that the walkthrough can progress easily.  

Once you have the start code in place, push it to GitHub.  Once the code is in GitHub, open your browser to the repo to proceed.

## Instructions

Ensure that you have a working program that is pushed into the repository before beginning.  Once that is in place, follow these instructions to let GitHub Copilot Agent work its magic on your repository.
